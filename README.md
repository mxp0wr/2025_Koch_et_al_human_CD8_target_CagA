# 2025_Koch_et_al_human_CD8_target_CagA
Currently under construction in preparation for review

This folder contains the notebook for the analysis of single cell RNA sequencing including CDR3 sequencing data derived from gastric T cells of pediatric and adult patients infected with Helicobacter pylori and uninfected controls (total 12).  This analysis is part of the paper "CD8+ T cell responses targeting CagA derived epitopes on epithelial cells shape human anti *Helicobacter pylori* immunity" by M.R.A. Koch et al., 2026. Raw data and pre-processed data is available on GEO under the accession number GSE308728. The processed and annotated data can be downloaded from Zenodo ([10.5281/zenodo.13981508](https://zenodo.org/uploads/17351178)).
