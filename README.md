**Currently under construction in preparation for review**

This folder contains the notebooks written to anaylize the single cell RNA sequencing data (scRNAseq) of the study "CD8+ T cell responses targeting CagA derived epitopes on epithelial cells shape human anti *Helicobacter pylori* immunity" by M.R.A. Koch et al., 2026, where we show that CagA specific CD8+ T cells profoundly shape human anti *H. pylori* immunity.
The scRNAseq analyses identify clonally expanded, distinct T cell populations linked to CagA exposure in human gastric biopsies.


## Data

The associated raw data and pre-processed data is available on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number GSE308728. The processed and annotated data can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/17351178). Data comprises single cell RNA sequencing including CDR3 sequencing data derived from gastric T cells of pediatric and adult patients infected with *Helicobacter pylori* and uninfected controls (total 12).
